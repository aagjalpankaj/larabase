# CI/CD

## CI
This boilerplate includes a built-in [GitHub CI workflow](../docs/../.github/workflows/100-ci.yml). As your application grows, feel free to modify it as needed.

## Deployment
To deploy the application to your preferred platform, you need to update the [GitHub CD workflow](../docs/../.github/workflows/200-cd.yml) accordingly.
